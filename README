XUM MIPS32-R1 Release - 31 Dec 2013
-----------------------------------

This is an implementation of the MIPS32 (Release 1) processor.

This design was created by Grant Ayers and funded by the 
eXtensible Utah Multicore (XUM) project at the University of Utah
from 2010-2012. It was previously hosted on OpenCores as 'mips32r1'.

This project provides all of the hardware and software needed to build
a MIPS32-compliant processor and several I/O peripherals all from scratch
and implement them on an FPGA. It contains a GCC- and binutils-based
cross-compiler toolchain to allow custom code to be compiled and run
on the hardware.
